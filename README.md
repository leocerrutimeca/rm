# Tactile maps and BIM to promote Accessibility 

## Data Collection:

To collect data, it will be necessary to present a variety of tactile maps developed with the help of BIM and gather feedback from people who are blind or have visual impairments.

The tactile maps will vary in size and features, allowing people who are blind or have visual impairments to choose which one works best for them.

### How is this process of collecting their feedback going to work?

To collect feedback, a questionnaire with 14 questions was developed to gather participantsâ€™ opinions on which type of tactile map they considered better.

The analysis of the data will begin after collecting their feedback and will be presented in the paper.
