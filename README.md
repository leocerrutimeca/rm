# Tactile maps and BIM to promote Accessibility 

## Data Collection:

To collect data, it will be necessary to present a variety of tactile maps developed with the help of BIM and gather feedback from people who are blind or have visual impairments.

### How is this process of collecting their feedback going to work?

To collect feedback, a questionnaire with 14 questions was developed to gather participantsâ€™ opinions on which type of tactile map they considered better.
